# ðŸŽ®Project: Tic Tac Toe | The Odin Project

## Web-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, made in pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using a modular approach and minimal global code.

### ðŸš€Project Description:

- The game board is stored as an array inside the Gameboard module.
- Players are represented by objects with a name and a symbol (X or O).

- All rendering and interaction with the DOM is concentrated in the ScreenController module.

### ðŸ”§Implementation features

- The module pattern (IIFE) is used for Gameboard, GameController, and ScreenController.
- A minimum of global code â€” everything is logically divided into areas of responsibility.
- Support for changing player names in real time.
- Check winning combinations and draws.
- Clearing the playing field and being able to start a new game with the "Restart" button.
